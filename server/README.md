# Server (Backend)

This folder contains the backend components of Creator’s Forge.

## Structure
- **src/adapters/** — Interfaces for external services (e.g., YouTube, Rumble, Spotify APIs).
- **src/routes/** — API endpoints that handle requests from the web frontend.
- **src/lib/** — Shared backend utilities and helpers.
- **test/** — Unit and integration tests.

## Purpose
The server layer powers Creator’s Forge modules such as the Uploader and Teleprompter by handling:
- Authentication
- File handling
- API communication
- Scheduling and automation
